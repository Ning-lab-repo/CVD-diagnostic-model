# box plot.py  
Compare the differences in metabolite distribution between different cardiovascular disease (CVD) subtypes and the non-CVD group, draw box plots and conduct statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U test), and perform FDR correction for multiple test results. Finally, save the box plots as PDF files.

# Heatmap(cvd vs noncvd).R 
This R code implements the metabolite data based on the UK Biobank samples, and creates a heatmap for the metabolite expression of both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD populations.

# Heatmap(Sampling 100).R 
This R code's function is to conduct sample screening and sampling (100) based on the NMR metabolite data from UK Biobank, and to draw a metabolite heatmap with group annotations related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnostic information.

# Horizontal tree diagram.R 
Construct and draw a hierarchical tree diagram (tree structure diagram), which can visually display the relationships and quantities of various diseases and their subcategories.

# Lollipop Chart.R 
Based on the AUC indicators in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) data, a sorted lollipop chart is drawn to visually present the magnitudes and differences of the AUC values for different diseases.

# model.py 
Model training, evaluation and calculation of statistical confidence intervals based on the list of diagnostic codes for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), as well as parallel processing of multiple disease codes.

# pie.R 
Segment the data by AUC values, count the quantities, and draw a pie chart.

# roc.py 
Estimate the confidence interval of AUC using the bootstrap method, and plot the ROC curves for each disease and save the figures as PDF files.

# Sankey Diagram.R 
Based on three groups of nodes (the left feature column, the middle disease ID, and the right feature column in the middle), a sorted Sankey Diagram is constructed to visualize the flow relationships among the three layers of variables. Finally, the diagram is saved as HTML and PNG files.

# shap.py 
Generate SHAP summary charts and numerical values for key features, process multiple CVD disease codes in batches, and save the results as PDF and CSV files.

# Stacked Chart.py 
Draw a stacked bar chart to show the diagnostic role of "different elements" in each file for these diseases, and finally generate a 4-row 1-column multi-subplot PDF chart.
